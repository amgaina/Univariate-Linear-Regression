# Univariate-Linear-Regression

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a univariate linear regression model using Python. The notebook demonstrates the complete workflow for training and evaluating a simple linear regression model, from hypothesis formulation to model evaluation. 

## Libraries Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting and visualizing data.

## Notebook Overview

1. **Hypothesis Function**
2. **Cost Function**
3. **Gradient Descent**
4. **Model Training**
5. **Model Evaluation**

## Conclusion

This notebook provides a clear and concise implementation of univariate linear regression using Python and essential data science libraries. By following the steps, we will learn how to formulate the hypothesis function, implement cost and gradient descent functions, and evaluate the performance of the linear regression model.
